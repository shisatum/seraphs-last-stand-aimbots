## tensorflow_scripts_backup
Backup of a collection of resources for the TensorFlow version of the aimbot that I'm working on. 
The exported model itself is a few hundred MB, so it's not included in this repo for the time being. 
If you want me to add all the files necessary to run this, create an issue or contact me and I'll do it.
